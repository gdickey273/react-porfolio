              <p>My name is Graham Dickey and I am a certified Full-Stack Web Developer through a bootcamp at UNC Chapel Hill. I am currently studying React Native so that I can lead a small team of developers in creating a Native Application for the city of Gibsonville, NC. When I'm not coding I enjoy playing music with my band, The Collection. I play trombone and trumpet in the band, and guitar on the side. Currently I work as a barista and bartender in Saxapahaw NC! Come and see me sometime.</p>
